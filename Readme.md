 # Equicontinuous
 Equicontinuous (aka Equi, aka EquiParallel -- whichever sticks) will one day be an interpreted parallel programming language.

 Equi is currently in **v.0.0.1 -- Chihuahua Blue**

 To run Equi, either set a system path to Equi (preferred), or run the executable in a shell script like so:

 ```
Equi -- -V 1
 ```

 This runs off of stdin (hence the -- as the second input) with a verbosity of 1 (will output the result of each line)

 If you want to run off of a file (say the test file 1--helloworld.equi), you can run it as so:

 ```
Equi 1--helloworld.equi
 ```
